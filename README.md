# CR6 Camera Bed Extended Mount

Remixed from [Creality CR-6 SE Bed Webcam Mount by ProfHawking on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4715726)

Using with cheap amazon webcam for Octoprint setup, which has a 1/4-20 mount, but sits really far forward and is hit during homing my the extruder with the original mount design

- Ended up redrawing in Fusion 360 instead of learning how to use Meshmixer
- Added more holes for camera mounting
- Opened up holes so they aren't friction fit/thread forming anymore
- Added M4 nut holder

## TO DO

1) Extend longer
2) Decide which holes to use
3) open up 6mm hole to 6.25-6.5mm for 1/4-20 clearance hole (maybe look up clearance hole size!)
